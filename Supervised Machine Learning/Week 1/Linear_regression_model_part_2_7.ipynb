    "### **How the Training Process Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Data:**\n",
    "   The training set contains examples of inputs (X) and their corresponding outputs (Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: A dataset where the input (X) is the size of houses and the output (Y) is their prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Learning Algorithm:**\n",
    "   The supervised learning algorithm is fed the training data (X and Y). It analyzes this data and generates a **function**, written as \\( f \\), which represents the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Output:**\n",
    "   - The function \\( f \\) takes a new input \\( X \\) and predicts an output \\( \\hat{Y} \\) (pronounced \"Y-hat\").\n",
    "   - \\( \\hat{Y} \\) is the **predicted value**. For example, the predicted price of a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Terms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model (f):** The function generated by the algorithm. It is used to make predictions.\n",
    "- **Input (X):** The features or data we use as input for the model (e.g., house size).\n",
    "- **Prediction (\\( \\hat{Y} \\)):** The estimated value of Y, generated by the model.\n",
    "- **Target (Y):** The true or actual value from the training set (e.g., the real price of a house).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example](images/One_Variable.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Linear Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video, the model is represented as a **linear function**:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "f(X) = w \\cdot X + b\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\\( w \\):** A parameter (weight) that determines the slope of the line.\n",
    "2. **\\( b \\):** A parameter (bias) that determines where the line intersects the Y-axis.\n",
    "3. **\\( f(X):** The output of the function, which is the predicted value \\( \\hat{Y} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "If \\( X \\) (house size) is 2000 square feet and:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( w = 300 \\)\n",
    "- \\( b = 50,000 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "f(X) = 300 \\cdot 2000 + 50,000 = 650,000\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The predicted price (\\( \\hat{Y} \\)) for a 2000 square-foot house is $650,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Visualizing the Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Representation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The X-axis represents the input feature (e.g., house size).\n",
    "   - The Y-axis represents the output target (e.g., house price).\n",
    "   - The training data points are plotted on the graph.\n",
    "   - The algorithm fits a straight line through the data points, known as the **best-fit line**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linear Regression:**\n",
    "   - The process of fitting a straight line to the data is called **linear regression**.\n",
    "   - This line is defined by the function \\( f(X) = w \\cdot X + b \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use a Straight Line?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A straight line (linear function) is **simple and easy to work with**.\n",
    "- While not all problems can be solved with straight lines (some require curves or more complex functions), starting with linear models helps build a strong foundation for more advanced techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Univariate Linear Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Univariate:** Means \"one variable.\"\n",
    "- In this case, the model predicts Y (house price) based on a single input feature, X (house size).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Making Predictions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is trained:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can input a new value of \\( X \\) (e.g., the size of a house) into the function \\( f(X) \\).\n",
    "- The model outputs \\( \\hat{Y} \\) (the predicted price of the house).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( \\hat{Y} \\) is an estimate and may not be the exact true value of \\( Y \\).\n",
    "- For example, the true price of a house is unknown until it is sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Improving the Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm adjusts the values of \\( w \\) (weight) and \\( b \\) (bias) to make the predictions as close as possible to the true values of \\( Y \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cost Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure how good the predictions are, we use a **cost function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The cost function calculates the error between the predicted values (\\( \\hat{Y} \\)) and the true values (Y).\n",
    "- The goal of the algorithm is to minimize this error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What's Next?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn how to construct a **cost function**.\n",
    "2. Use the cost function to fine-tune the model for better predictions.\n",
    "3. Explore more advanced models, including non-linear functions.\n"
