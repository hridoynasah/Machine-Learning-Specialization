    "\n",
    "- **\"After supervised learning, the most widely used form of machine learning is unsupervised learning.\"**  \n",
    "  This means that after supervised learning (where we teach the algorithm using labeled data), unsupervised learning is the next most popular method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"Let's take a look at what that means.\"**  \n",
    "  Now, we'll explore what \"unsupervised learning\" is and how it works.\n",

    "### **Comparing Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"When we're looking at supervised learning in the last lecture, recall it looks something like this in the case of a classification problem.\"**  \n",
    "  In supervised learning, we have input data (like tumor size and patient age) and output labels (like whether a tumor is benign or malignant).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"Each example was associated with an output label y such as benign or malignant, designated by the poles and crosses.\"**  \n",
    "  Supervised learning uses examples with clear answers or \"labels,\" like 'X' for malignant and 'O' for benign.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"In unsupervised learning, we're given data that isn't associated with any output labels y.\"**  \n",
    "  In unsupervised learning, we only have input data and **no labels** telling us the \"right\" answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **An Example of Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"Say you're given data on patients and their tumor size and the patient's age, but not whether the tumor was benign or malignant.\"**  \n",
    "  Imagine you have data like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Patient A: Age 40, Tumor size 2 cm\n",
    "  - Patient B: Age 60, Tumor size 4 cm  \n",
    "    But you don’t know if their tumors are benign (harmless) or malignant (dangerous).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"The dataset looks like this on the right.\"**  \n",
    "  This refers to the chart or graph where the data points (patients) are plotted based on their age and tumor size.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Example Image](images/Unsupervised.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"We're not asked to diagnose whether the tumor is benign or malignant, because we're not given any labels y in the dataset.\"**  \n",
    "  Unlike supervised learning, we don’t have answers (labels) like \"benign\" or \"malignant\" to guide us.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"Instead, our job is to find some structure or some pattern or just find something interesting in the data.\"**  \n",
    "  Here, the goal is to figure out patterns in the data without having labels to guide us.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"This is unsupervised learning.\"**  \n",
    "  This is what unsupervised learning is all about: discovering patterns or relationships in unlabeled data.\n",

    "### **Clustering Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"An unsupervised learning algorithm might decide that the data can be assigned to two different groups or two different clusters.\"**  \n",
    "  The algorithm might notice that the data naturally forms two groups (clusters) based on similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"And so it might decide that there's one cluster or group over here, and there's another cluster or group over here.\"**  \n",
    "  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Cluster 1: Patients with small tumors and younger ages.\n",
    "  - Cluster 2: Patients with large tumors and older ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"This is a particular type of unsupervised learning called a clustering algorithm.\"**  \n",
    "  Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning where data is grouped into similar clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Clustering in Real Life: Google News Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example Image](images/GoogleNews.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"For example, clustering is used in Google News.\"**  \n",
    "  Clustering is used by Google News to group related news stories together.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"What Google News does is every day it looks at hundreds of thousands of news articles on the internet and groups related stories together.\"**  \n",
    "  Google’s algorithm reads all the news articles on the internet and identifies which ones are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"For example, here is a sample from Google News, where the headline of the top article is 'Giant panda gives birth to rare twin cubs at Japan's oldest zoo.'”**  \n",
    "  Let’s say this is one article. The algorithm looks at all articles and finds others with similar words or topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"The algorithm notices repeated words like \"panda,\" \"twins,\" and \"zoo\" and groups articles with these common words together.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"The clustering algorithm is finding articles that mention similar words and grouping them into clusters.\"**  \n",
    "  The algorithm groups related articles into one cluster based on shared words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"There isn’t an employee at Google News who’s telling the algorithm to find articles with these specific words.\"**  \n",
    "  No one manually tells the algorithm what to group. The algorithm figures it out on its own. This is why it’s \"unsupervised.\"\n",

    "### **Clustering Genetic Data Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example Image](images/DNA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"This image shows a picture of DNA microarray data.\"**  \n",
    "  DNA microarrays are like spreadsheets showing genetic information for multiple individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"Each column represents one person, and each row represents a gene.\"**  \n",
    "  Think of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Each column is a person (Person A, Person B, etc.).\n",
    "  - Each row is a gene (e.g., eye color gene, height gene).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"What you can do is run a clustering algorithm to group individuals into categories or types of people.\"**  \n",
    "  The algorithm looks at patterns in the data and groups similar people together based on their genetic traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Sure, here’s a detailed explanation of the DNA clustering example:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we have data from a **DNA microarray**, which is a tool used to analyze genetic information. This data is visually represented as a grid, somewhat like a **spreadsheet**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Columns Represent Individuals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Each column in this grid corresponds to the **genetic information** of one person.\n",
    "   - For instance:\n",
    "     - Column 1 might represent \"Person A.\"\n",
    "     - Column 2 might represent \"Person B.\"\n",
    "     - Each column contains data about that person’s DNA activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rows Represent Genes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Each row in the grid corresponds to a **specific gene**.\n",
    "   - For example:\n",
    "     - Row 1 could represent a gene that influences **eye color**.\n",
    "     - Row 2 might represent a gene that affects **height**.\n",
    "     - Another row might represent a gene linked to whether someone likes or dislikes certain foods, such as broccoli, brussels sprouts, or asparagus. (Fun fact: Scientists have discovered a genetic link to food preferences!)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Color Coding of Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The grid is color-coded to show how active each gene is for each individual.\n",
    "   - For example:\n",
    "     - **Red** might indicate a highly active gene.\n",
    "     - **Green** might show a less active gene.\n",
    "     - **Gray** could represent a gene that isn’t active at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "   These colors allow researchers to quickly visualize differences and similarities in genetic activity across individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Clustering Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Now comes the role of the **unsupervised learning algorithm**, specifically a **clustering algorithm**.\n",
    "   - The algorithm takes this genetic data (columns and rows) and analyzes it to identify **patterns**.\n",
    "   - It groups individuals into clusters based on similarities in their genetic profiles.\n",
    "     - For example:\n",
    "       - People with similar DNA activity might be grouped together into **Cluster 1**.\n",
    "       - Another set of individuals with a different pattern might form **Cluster 2**.\n",
    "       - Yet another group might be categorized as **Cluster 3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Predefined Labels:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Here’s what makes this unsupervised learning:\n",
    "     - We don’t tell the algorithm, “This is what makes a person belong to Type 1, Type 2, or Type 3.”\n",
    "     - Instead, we give it all the data and say, “Figure out the groups or clusters yourself.”\n",
    "   - The algorithm works independently to find **structure** in the data and identify patterns that group similar individuals together.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Practical Use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Researchers use these clusters to study **genetic traits** and how they relate to health, behavior, or other characteristics.\n",
    "   - For example:\n",
    "     - Cluster 1 might include people prone to certain diseases.\n",
    "     - Cluster 2 could represent individuals with specific dietary preferences or tolerances.\n",
    "     - Cluster 3 might highlight genetic markers linked to height or physical characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Why It’s Unsupervised Learning:**\n",
    "   - Unlike supervised learning, we don’t provide the algorithm with a predefined “right answer” (like labeling people as “tall” or “short” based on a specific gene).\n",
    "   - Instead, the algorithm learns to group individuals based on their **own patterns** and relationships within the data.\n",

    "  Clustering groups unlabeled data into clusters based on similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"So maybe the next time you see or think of a panda, maybe you think of clustering as well.\"**  \n",
    "  A fun way to remember clustering—think of pandas grouped together based on their shared features!\n"
