# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a transformative technology that you likely interact with multiple times a day, often without realizing it. At its core, machine learning is the science of enabling computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. This field empowers systems to analyze data, identify patterns, and improve their performance over time, making them integral to many modern applications.

### Everyday Applications of Machine Learning

Machine learning is embedded in many of the tools and services you use daily. Consider the following examples:

- **Web Search**: When you search for something like "how to make a sushi roll" on engines like Google, Bing, or Baidu, machine learning algorithms rank web pages to deliver the most relevant results. These algorithms analyze vast amounts of data to understand what makes a webpage useful, ensuring you get accurate and helpful information quickly.
  
- **Social Media**: On platforms like Instagram or Snapchat, you can upload photos and tag your friends. Machine learning powers facial recognition technology, which identifies and labels individuals in your pictures, making it seamless to share moments with others.

- **Streaming Services**: After watching a movie like *Star Wars* on a streaming platform, you might wonder, "What other movies would I enjoy?" Machine learning algorithms analyze your viewing history and preferences to recommend similar content, enhancing your entertainment experience.

- **Voice Assistants**: Whether you’re dictating a text message ("Hey Andrew, how’s it going?"), requesting a song ("Hey Siri, play a song by Rihanna"), or searching for nearby restaurants ("Okay Google, show me Indian restaurants near me"), voice-to-text and command recognition rely on machine learning to interpret and respond to your voice accurately.

- **Email Filtering**: When you receive an email with a suspicious subject line like "Congratulations! You’ve won a million dollars," your email service likely flags it as spam. Machine learning algorithms detect patterns in email content to distinguish legitimate messages from spam, keeping your inbox clean.

### Machine Learning Beyond Consumer Applications

While machine learning enhances everyday consumer experiences, its impact extends far beyond personal use. It is rapidly transforming industries and addressing global challenges. Here are a few examples:

You’ll also become familiar with key terminology and learn when to apply different algorithms to solve specific problems. Let’s continue this journey and dive deeper into the world of machine learning.


# Defining Machine Learning and Its Major Types

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is the field of study that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. This definition, attributed to Arthur Samuel in the 1950s, captures the essence of how machines can improve their performance through experience. A notable example is Samuel’s checkers-playing program. Despite Samuel not being a skilled checkers player himself, he created a program that played tens of thousands of games against itself. By analyzing which board positions led to wins or losses, the program learned to identify favorable moves and avoid poor ones. Over time, this self-play allowed the computer to surpass Samuel’s own checkers-playing ability, demonstrating the power of machine learning to acquire expertise through data-driven experience.

The key insight from this example is that the more opportunities a machine learning algorithm has to learn—such as through repeated games or exposure to data—the better it performs. This principle of learning through experience is fundamental to the field and applies across various applications.

## Types of Machine Learning and Their Algorithms

Machine learning encompasses several approaches, each suited to different types of problems. The two primary types are supervised learning and unsupervised learning, with additional methods like recommender systems and reinforcement learning also playing significant roles. Below is an overview of these types, along with a brief explanation and representative algorithms for each:

- **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms learn from labeled data to predict outcomes or classify new data points (e.g., predicting house prices or identifying spam emails).
  - **Linear Regression**: Predicts a continuous output variable based on input features (e.g., estimating house prices from size and location).
  - **Logistic Regression**: Classifies data into discrete categories (e.g., determining if an email is spam or not).
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds the optimal boundary to separate classes in classification tasks (e.g., classifying images as cats or dogs).
  - **Decision Trees**: Makes decisions by splitting data into branches based on feature values (e.g., predicting customer churn).
  - **Neural Networks**: Models complex patterns using interconnected layers of nodes (e.g., recognizing handwriting).

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms find patterns or groupings in unlabeled data without predefined outputs (e.g., clustering customers based on purchasing behavior).
  - **K-Means Clustering**: Groups data into k clusters based on similarity (e.g., segmenting customers for marketing).
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces data dimensionality while preserving variance (e.g., simplifying datasets for visualization).
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a tree of clusters to reveal data hierarchies (e.g., grouping similar products).
  - **Autoencoders**: Neural networks that learn to compress and reconstruct data (e.g., denoising images).

- **Recommender Systems**: Specialized algorithms suggest items or content based on user preferences and behavior (e.g., recommending movies on streaming platforms).
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items based on user-item interactions (e.g., suggesting movies based on user ratings).
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items by matching item features to user preferences (e.g., suggesting books based on genres liked).
  - **Matrix Factorization**: Decomposes user-item interaction matrices to predict preferences (e.g., Netflix’s recommendation engine).

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms learn by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties to optimize actions (e.g., training a robot to navigate obstacles).
  - **Q-Learning**: Learns an action-value function to choose optimal actions in a given state (e.g., training a game-playing agent).
  - **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: Combines Q-learning with neural networks for complex environments (e.g., playing Atari games).
  - **Policy Gradient Methods**: Directly optimizes the policy that maps states to actions (e.g., training a robot to walk).

Among these, supervised learning is the most widely used and has seen rapid advancements, making it a cornerstone of many real-world applications. This course will delve deeply into supervised learning in the first two parts, while the third part will cover unsupervised learning, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning.

## The Importance of Practical Application

Learning machine learning algorithms is like acquiring a set of powerful tools, such as a state-of-the-art hammer or drill. However, having the tools is only part of the equation—knowing how to use them effectively is equally, if not more, important. Just as providing someone with tools doesn’t guarantee they can build a house, understanding machine learning algorithms doesn’t automatically translate to building successful systems. This course emphasizes practical advice for applying these algorithms, drawing on best practices used by top machine learning engineers.

In the real world, even experienced teams can spend months pursuing ineffective approaches. By learning the right techniques, you can avoid common pitfalls and develop valuable, high-performing machine learning systems efficiently. This course aims to equip you with both the tools and the skills to design and implement robust machine learning solutions, positioning you among the rare individuals who can build impactful systems in today’s world.

## What’s Next?

In the upcoming sections, we’ll explore supervised learning and unsupervised learning in greater detail, including their definitions, applications, and when to use each. You’ll also gain a deeper understanding of how to select the appropriate algorithm for specific problems. Let’s move forward and dive into these core concepts of machine learning.



# Supervised Learning and Regression

## Understanding Supervised Learning

Supervised learning, the most economically impactful type of machine learning today, accounts for approximately 99 percent of the value generated by machine learning applications. It involves algorithms that learn to map inputs (denoted as \( x \)) to outputs (denoted as \( y \)), creating input-to-output mappings. The defining feature of supervised learning is the use of labeled data—examples where both the input \( x \) and the correct output \( y \) (the label) are provided. By training on these input-output pairs, the algorithm learns to predict the output \( y \) for new, unseen inputs \( x \), producing reasonably accurate results.

### Examples of Supervised Learning Applications

Supervised learning powers a wide range of real-world applications by learning from labeled examples. The following table outlines key examples:

| Input (\( x \))         | Output (\( y \))       | Application             |
|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| email                   | spam? (0/1)           | spam filtering           |
| audio                   | text transcripts      | speech recognition       |
| English                 | Spanish               | machine translation      |
| ad, user info           | click? (0/1)          | online advertising       |
| image, radar info       | position of other cars | self-driving car         |
| image of phone          | defect? (0/1)         | visual inspection        |

In each case, the algorithm is trained on a dataset containing input-output pairs (\( x, y \)). After training, it can predict the appropriate output \( y \) for new inputs \( x \) it has never encountered.

## Regression: A Key Type of Supervised Learning

To illustrate supervised learning, consider a practical example: predicting housing prices based on house size. Suppose you have a dataset where the input \( x \) is the size of a house in square feet, and the output \( y \) is the price in thousands of dollars. When plotted, the data shows house sizes on the horizontal axis and prices on the vertical axis.

Imagine a friend wants to know the price of their 750-square-foot house. A supervised learning algorithm can help by modeling the relationship between house size and price. For instance:

- **Linear Model**: The algorithm might fit a straight line to the data, predicting a price of approximately $150,000 for the 750-square-foot house.
- **Non-Linear Model**: Alternatively, a more complex model, such as a curve, might better capture the data’s pattern, predicting a price closer to $200,000.

The choice between a straight line, a curve, or a more complex function depends on the data’s characteristics. Later in this course, you’ll learn how to systematically select the most appropriate model for a given dataset, ensuring accurate predictions rather than arbitrarily choosing the model that yields the highest price.

This housing price example can be visualized as a linear regression graph:

```
Price in $1000's
400 |                                     
300 |                                     
200 |         *                       *   
150 |     *               *         *     
100 | *               *         *         
 50 |                                     
  0 |___________________________________
      0    500    1000   1500   2000   2500
           House size in square feet
```

- The graph shows a straight line fitted to data points (marked with *), where house size (x-axis) ranges from 0 to 2500 square feet, and price (y-axis) ranges from 0 to 400 thousand dollars.
- For a 750-square-foot house, the linear model predicts a price around $150,000, indicated by a point on the line.

This housing price example is a specific type of supervised learning called **regression**. In regression, the goal is to predict a continuous numerical output, such as a house price, which can take any value within a range (e.g., $150,000, $183,000, or $70,000). The algorithm learns from a dataset where the correct output (the “right answer” or label \( y \)) is provided for each input \( x \), enabling it to generalize and predict prices for new houses.

## What’s Next?

Supervised learning, particularly regression, is a powerful tool for predicting numerical outcomes. However, supervised learning also includes another major type called classification, which deals with predicting categorical outcomes. In the next section, we’ll explore classification and how it differs from regression, deepening your understanding of supervised learning’s versatility.
