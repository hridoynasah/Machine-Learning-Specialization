    "### 1. **What is Supervised Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning** means teaching a model using a dataset where both inputs and their correct outputs are already known.\n",
    "- For example, in our case:\n",
    "  - Input: Size of the house (in square feet)\n",
    "  - Output: Price of the house (in thousands of dollars)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to train the model on this data so it can predict the price of a house based on its size.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **What is a Linear Regression Model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Linear Regression Model** is a way of fitting a straight line to your data points. This line helps predict the output (price) based on the input (size).\n",
    "- It’s one of the simplest and most widely used machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Real-World Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imagine you're a real estate agent in Portland, USA.\n",
    "- A client asks you: _\"How much can I sell my house for?\"_\n",
    "- You measure the size of her house, which is **1,250 square feet**.\n",
    "- Using the data you already have (sizes and prices of other houses), you create a Linear Regression Model.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. **How Does Linear Regression Work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You plot the data points of house sizes (x-axis) and prices (y-axis).\n",
    "- Each **point** represents a house. For example:\n",
    "  - A house with size 2,104 sq ft and price $400,000 is one point on the graph.\n",
    "- Then, the model fits a **straight line** that best matches all the points.\n",
    "- Once the line is drawn, you can use it to predict prices for new houses.\n",
    "  - For a 1,250 sq ft house, the line shows the price as approximately $220,000.\n",

    "### 5. **Key Terms in Supervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Set**: This is the dataset you use to teach the model. It includes examples where both inputs (size) and outputs (price) are known.\n",
    "  - Example: A table with house sizes and prices.\n",
    "- **Input Variable (x)**: The feature or characteristic used to make a prediction. Here, x = size of the house.\n",
    "- **Output Variable (y)**: The value we want to predict. Here, y = price of the house.\n",
    "- **Training Example**: A single row in the dataset, like (2,104, $400,000).\n",
    "- **Number of Examples (m)**: The total number of rows in the dataset. For instance, if the table has 47 rows, then m = 47.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6. **Mathematical Notation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each training example is written as a pair: **(x, y)**.\n",
    "  - Example: For the first house in the dataset, **x = 2,104** and **y = 400** (in thousands of dollars).\n",
    "- To refer to a specific example:\n",
    "  - Use **x^(i)** and **y^(i)**, where **i** is the row number (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).\n",
    "  - Example: For the first house (i = 1):\n",
    "    - **x^(1) = 2,104** (size)\n",
    "    - **y^(1) = 400** (price)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Regression vs. Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of supervised learning models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regression Models**:\n",
    "   - Predict continuous numbers, like house prices ($220,000) or temperatures (30.5°C).\n",
    "   - Linear Regression is one example of this.\n",
    "2. **Classification Models**:\n",
    "   - Predict categories or labels, like:\n",
    "     - Whether an image is of a **cat** or **dog**.\n",
    "     - Whether a patient has a specific disease (**yes** or **no**).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Visualizing Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset can be shown in two ways:\n",
    "  1. **Graph**: Points on a chart, with the x-axis as size and the y-axis as price.\n",
    "  2. **Table**: A list of house sizes and their prices.\n",
    "     - Each row in the table corresponds to a point on the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **What’s Next?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now that we know what a **training set** is and how to represent data, the next step is feeding this data into a learning algorithm.\n",
    "- This algorithm will learn the relationship between size and price to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supervised learning involves training a model with input-output pairs.\n",
    "- A Linear Regression Model fits a straight line to the data to predict continuous outputs like house prices.\n",
    "- Key terms like input (x), output (y), and training set help us organize the data.\n",
    "- Regression predicts numbers, while classification predicts categories.\n"
