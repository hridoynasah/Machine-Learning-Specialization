    "Summation notation is a compact way of writing the sum of a series of terms. It uses the Greek capital letter sigma (âˆ‘) to indicate that you are summing a sequence of numbers defined by a specific formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical summation expression looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i=a}^{b} f(i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$\\sum$**: This is the summation symbol.\n",
    "- **$i$**: This is the index of summation; it represents each term's position.\n",
    "- **$a$**: The lower limit; the summation starts with $i = a$.\n",
    "- **$b$**: The upper limit; the summation continues until $i = b$.\n",
    "- **$f(i)$**: This is the general term (or formula) that depends on $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Simple Sum of Natural Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum the first 5 natural numbers, you write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^{5} i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Sum of Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to sum the squares of the first 4 numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^{4} i^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expands to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Summations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity:**  \n",
    "   For any constants $c$ and $d$ and functions $f(i)$ and $g(i)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\sum_{i=a}^{b} [c \\cdot f(i) + d \\cdot g(i)] = c \\sum_{i=a}^{b} f(i) + d \\sum_{i=a}^{b} g(i)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Splitting the Sum:**  \n",
    "   You can split a summation over a range into two parts. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\sum_{i=1}^{b} f(i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} f(i) + \\sum_{i=k+1}^{b} f(i)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Changing the Index:**  \n",
    "   Sometimes you may want to change the index of summation. For example, if you let $j = i - 1$, then:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(i) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} f(j+1)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Simple Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have the summation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} (2i + 3)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compute each term and then add them up:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When $i=1$: $2(1) + 3 = 5$\n",
    "- When $i=2$: $2(2) + 3 = 7$\n",
    "- $\\vdots$\n",
    "- When $i=10$: $2(10) + 3 = 23$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, $S = 5 + 7 + 9 + \\dots + 23$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, using properties of summation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} (2i + 3) = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{10} i + 3 \\sum_{i=1}^{10} 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^{10} i = \\frac{10(10+1)}{2} = 55 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{10} 1 = 10\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = 2(55) + 3(10) = 110 + 30 = 140\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summation notation ($\\sum$)** compactly represents the sum of a sequence of terms.\n",
    "- The expression $\\sum_{i=a}^{b} f(i)$ means you sum the values of $f(i)$ as $i$ runs from $a$ to $b$.\n",
    "- Basic properties such as linearity help break down and simplify more complex summations.\n"
