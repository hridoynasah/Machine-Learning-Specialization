    "### **üöÄ Understanding Vectorization in Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization is one of the most important techniques for speeding up machine learning algorithms. It allows us to perform operations on entire arrays at once rather than using slow for-loops. Let's break it down step by step. üîç\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7065401/52071924-c003ad80-2562-11e9-8297-1c6595f8a7ff.png\" alt=\"green-divider\">\n",

    "#### **üß† Why is Vectorization Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with large datasets, our algorithms can become very slow if we perform calculations one by one. Imagine calculating values step by step using a for-loop‚Äîit takes a long time! Vectorization speeds up this process by using parallel processing capabilities of the CPU or GPU. üñ•Ô∏è‚ö°\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **üîé Understanding the Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have an algorithm that needs to process **16 numbers**. We can write this using a loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for j in range(16):\n",
    "    result[j] = w[j] * x[j]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs what happens behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At time **t‚ÇÄ**, the first value is computed.\n",
    "- At time **t‚ÇÅ**, the second value is computed.\n",
    "- This continues until **t‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ**, where the last value is computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the operations happen **one after another** ‚è≥.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7065401/52071924-c003ad80-2562-11e9-8297-1c6595f8a7ff.png\" alt=\"green-divider\">\n",

    "#### **üöÄ How Vectorization Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of running one computation at a time, vectorization allows us to **perform multiple calculations at the same time**. This is like magic! üé©‚ú®\n",
    "\n",
    "In **NumPy**, we can write the same operation like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = w * x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens now?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The computer **takes all 16 numbers at once**.\n",
    "- It **multiplies them in parallel**.\n",
    "- Then, it **sums them up quickly** using specialized hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **much faster** than using a loop! üöÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7065401/52071924-c003ad80-2562-11e9-8297-1c6595f8a7ff.png\" alt=\"green-divider\">\n",

    "#### **üìä Vectorization in Multiple Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see how vectorization helps with multiple linear regression. Suppose we have **16 features** with parameters **w‚ÇÅ to w‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ**. Each weight **w‚±º** is updated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w_j = w_j - \\alpha \\cdot d_j $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Without vectorization, we update each weight one at a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for j in range(16):\n",
    "    w[j] = w[j] - 0.1 * d[j]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With vectorization, we can do everything in **one step**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "w = w - 0.1 * d\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **much faster** because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The computer **subtracts all 16 values at once**.\n",
    "- It uses **optimized hardware** to perform the operations efficiently. üí°\n",
