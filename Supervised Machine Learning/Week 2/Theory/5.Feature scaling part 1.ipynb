    "### 🎯 **Understanding the Relationship Between Feature Size and Parameter Value**\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to predict the price of a house using **two features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **x₁**: Size of the house (in square feet) 🏠\n",
    "- **x₂**: Number of bedrooms 🛏️\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Data 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "- House sizes (**x₁**) range from **300 to 2000** square feet.\n",
    "- Number of bedrooms (**x₂**) ranges from **0 to 5**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since x₁ has a **large range** and x₂ has a **small range**, the corresponding parameters (**w₁ and w₂**) will also take different scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario 1: Parameter Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a house has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Size **2000** sq. ft.\n",
    "- **5** bedrooms\n",
    "- Actual price = **$500,000** 💰\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose parameter values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **w₁ = 50, w₂ = 0.1, b = 50**\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicted price:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P = 50 \\times 2000 + 0.1 \\times 5 + 50\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P = 100,000 + 0.5 + 50 \\approx 100,050,000\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **This is an extremely high and incorrect price!**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario 2: Swapping w₁ and w₂\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **w₁ = 0.1, w₂ = 50, b = 50**\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicted price:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P = 0.1 \\times 2000 + 50 \\times 5 + 50\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P = 200 + 250 + 50 = 500,000\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **This correctly predicts the house price!**\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Key Takeaway**: When the feature range is large, the parameter is small (0.1 for house size), and when the feature range is small, the parameter is large (50 for bedrooms). ⚖️\n",

    "\n",
    "When plotting data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **x₁ (house size)** is on the **horizontal axis** 📏\n",
    "- **x₂ (bedrooms)** is on the **vertical axis** 📊\n",

    "Since x₁ has a **much larger range**, the **cost function contours** become **elongated ellipses** 🏛️.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔄 **Gradient Descent Issue**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Due to the **elongated shape**, gradient descent **bounces back and forth**, taking **longer to converge** ❌.\n",
    "- If x₁ and x₂ were on **similar scales**, the contours would be **more circular**, and gradient descent would find the minimum faster. ⏩\n",

    "### 🎯 **Solution: Feature Scaling**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature scaling** transforms features so they take on similar ranges of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- x₁: **300 - 2000** → **0 to 1**\n",
    "- x₂: **0 - 5** → **0 to 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 After scaling, gradient descent moves **directly to the minimum** instead of bouncing around. 🏆\n",

    "### ✨ **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Feature Scaling** speeds up gradient descent by ensuring all features have similar value ranges.\n",
    "✅ If one feature has a large range and another has a small range, parameters (w) will be very different.\n",
    "✅ Without scaling, gradient descent takes longer due to an **elongated cost function shape**.\n",
    "✅ After scaling, the cost function becomes more circular, allowing **faster convergence**. 🎯\n",
