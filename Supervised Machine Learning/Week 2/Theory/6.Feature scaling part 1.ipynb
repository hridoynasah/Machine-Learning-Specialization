    "### **📌 Feature Scaling Explained in Simple Terms**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling is a technique to make sure different features (variables) in a dataset have similar ranges. Without scaling, one feature could have values in the thousands while another has values between 0 and 5, making it difficult for machine learning models to perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Why is Feature Scaling Important?**  \n",
    "Imagine you have two features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **House Size (sq ft)** 🏠 → ranges from **300 to 2000**\n",
    "- **Number of Bedrooms** 🛏️ → ranges from **0 to 5**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these two have very different numerical ranges, machine learning algorithms might give more importance to one over the other. Feature scaling fixes this!\n",

    "#### **🔢 Different Methods of Feature Scaling**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three popular methods of feature scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1️⃣ Min-Max Scaling (Normalization)**\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 This method rescales the values to a fixed range **[0,1]**.  \n",
    "👉 We divide each value by the maximum value of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x' = \\frac{x}{\\max(x)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Example:**  \n",
    "If **House Size** varies from **300 to 2000**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x' = \\frac{x}{2000}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the house size is **600**, the scaled value will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{600}{2000} = 0.3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If **Bedrooms** range from **0 to 5**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x' = \\frac{x}{5}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the number of bedrooms is **3**, the scaled value will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{3}{5} = 0.6\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **After scaling, all features are between 0 and 1!**\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2️⃣ Mean Normalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 This method centers the data around **0** (some values become negative, some positive).  \n",
    "👉 Each value is adjusted by subtracting the mean and dividing by the range (max - min).\n",

    "🔹 **Formula:**\n",

    "$$\n",
    "x' = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\max(x) - \\min(x)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where **$ \\mu $** is the mean of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Example:**  \n",
    "If **House Size** has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean **$ \\mu_1 = 600 $**\n",
    "- Max = **2000**\n",
    "- Min = **300**\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for a house size of **600**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x' = \\frac{600 - 600}{2000 - 300} = \\frac{0}{1700} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For **Bedrooms**, if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean **$ \\mu_2 = 2.3 $**\n",
    "- Max = **5**\n",
    "- Min = **0**\n",
    "\n",
    "For 3 bedrooms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x' = \\frac{3 - 2.3}{5 - 0} = \\frac{0.7}{5} = 0.14\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
