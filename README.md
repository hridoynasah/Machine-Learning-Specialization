## Course Progress

This repository tracks my progress through the Machine Learning Specialization. I have completed portions of the course and earned a certificate, which can be found in the `Extra/Certificates/` directory.

## Lab Work

The repository contains both the original lab exercises (in LAB_Wx folders) and completed solutions (in LAB folders). Each week includes:
- Hands-on programming exercises
- Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations
- Programming assignments
- Supporting files (data, utilities, etc.)

## Certificate

Upon completion of course components, I received a certificate from Coursera. The certificate PDF is stored in `Extra/Certificates/Coursera 1XZ2WHDS8H4C.pdf`.

## Additional Resources

The `Extra` folder contains supplementary materials:
- Additional practice notebooks
- Clarification notes
- Course certificates

## Development Environment

The notebooks in this repository are developed using Jupyter Notebook and can be run in environments with Python and the required machine learning libraries installed.
