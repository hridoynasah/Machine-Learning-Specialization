# Machine Learning Specialization

This repository contains my work and notes from the Machine Learning Specialization course by Coursera. The course is divided into three main sections:

1. **Supervised Machine Learning**
   - Regression and Classification
   - Gradient Descent
   - Feature Engineering

2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**
   - Neural Networks
   - Decision Trees
   - Advanced Models

3. **Course Materials**
   - Weekly Labs and Solutions
   - Programming Assignments
   - Lecture Slides
   - Additional Resources

## Course Progress

This repository tracks my progress through the Machine Learning Specialization. I have completed portions of the course and earned a certificate, which can be found in the `Extra/Certificates/` directory.

## Development Environment

The notebooks in this repository are developed using:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Additional utilities provided in the course

To run these notebooks:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required Python packages
3. Open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook
